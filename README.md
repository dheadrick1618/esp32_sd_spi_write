# Writing data to an SD card using SPI with an ESP32 

For PEPPER-X 

To measure the datarate for writing to an SD card using SPI configuration.

The goal is to achieve at least 3Mbps write speed, as this is around the rate that data will be generated by a source that this device is exptected to read from.

## USAGE 

This project use the ESP-IDF framework.

The SD card we are interacting with is assumed to already be formatted in a version of the FAT file system, although I have only tested this with FAT32 partitions. That being said we are using VFS (Virtual File System) to mount a parition and access files, which should work with any variety of FAT FS.

**It should be noted that the menuconfig (sdkconfig) must be used to enable Long File Names (LFN) as they are disabled by default and given the chance we may want to access files with names longer than 8 characters (the SFN limit) this must be done**
